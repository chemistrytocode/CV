## Paul Ayling

Up until recently I worked as a Chemistry Teacher and my 9 year career in this field started in a struggling State School and ended in a Top 50 UK Independent School. This experience has given me a unique perspective when it comes to motivation and learning and I consider myself to be exceptionally skilled when it comes to *'getting the best from people'*.

Currently I am employed as a Junior Software Engineer and am about to embark on an Apprenticeship with the Makerâ€™s Academy. I undertook this great change in my career after answering the very question I impressed upon countless students over the years: __**"What motivates you?"**__.

My answer was challenges, competition, learning new skills and having clear recognizable markers of my own ability and efforts. After teaching myself to code in my spare time for years and creating a number of my own projects I realized that there was no better place for me to harness my own skills and secure my future happiness than Software Engineering.

## Skills

#### Presentation & Workflow

With 9 years experience in Teaching I consider myself to a very strong communicator and relayer of information. I pride myself on being able to quickly judge the attentiveness and competency of a group and can adjust my delivery of information or rate of workflow accordingly.

#### Self-Learning

Whenever I have an interest in something I pursue it. 

My interest in programming led to me enroll in an Open University degree whilst working a 48+ hour week, whilst in addition to my interests in chemistry I am also a competent car mechanic, plumber, weightlifter and marksman through being trained as an instructor for the L98 Cadet Rifle in my previous role.

#### Analysis

Thinking analytically has always been a strong point of mine which have been further enhanced by my time as a Scientist and Educator. Knowing which questions to ask, which data points to look at, which patterns to recognize and the reasoning behind an answer are all skills that have served me very well in the past and will continue to do so as a developer.

## Interests

I've been a weightlifter for nearly 10 years and have followed Bodybuilding and Strength competitions with much enthusiasm over this time. I am also a keen mechanic and have worked on numerous cars over the years, my latest project was a written off Saab which I repaired, self-serviced, reprogrammed the ECU and then sold on for a profit last year.

Finally I am an active traveller and thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in different cultures. My most memorable experiences to date being backpacking across Europe and roadtripping across the US.
