## Paul Ayling

I have been and will always be a Scientist and an Explorer who is driven by the desire to answer the question of "Why?" with my own variation of "How?". Consequently my views on the world has caused me to develop a rather broad range of knowledge along with a set of rather bizarre interests and skills that many would consider contradictary.

In the past I worked in education as a Chemistry Teacher which I undertook for around 9 years. 

During this time I worked within both a State and a Top50 UK Independent School and dealt with the various challenges that each demographic brings from motivating both disheartened children who feel they won't achieve anything and uninterested children who's parents will always provide everything. I consider myself to be a great advocate of sharing knowledge and 'being your best' and feel that learning and motivation are skills in their own right that should be harnessed and developed in order to produce success.

Currently I am employed as a Junior Software Engineer at comparethemarket.com and am about to undertake a Maker's Academy apprenticeship. This great change in my career has been fueled by my passion for knowledge and backed by the challenge of creativity and problem solving that exists in no other sector than the rapididly changing realm of technology.
